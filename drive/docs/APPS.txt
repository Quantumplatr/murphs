[b]--- APPS ---[/b]
Applications are primarily used for completing tasks. Starting an application will open it in the "Main" window. Applications related to tasks will require a project name (e.g. [color=purple]refine Delta[/color] compared to just [color=purple]settings[/color]). See available apps with the [color=purple]help[/color] command.

[b]- Settings & Extras -[/b]
These apps are not within the context of the game and are meant for actual game settings and extras.
