Upon starting Murphsweeper, you'll be met with a grid of cells. Some of the cells [shake]CANNOT[/shake] be opened. However, you must open all other cells. Don't worry, your first cell is always safe. Any safe cells with unsafe neighbors will indicate how many neighbors are unsafe. Use this information to determine which cells are safe/unsafe. 

Take this example: (? means unopened cell)

1??
122
000

You the middle two indicates there are 2 unsafe cells in the neighboring 8 spaces. With only 2 cells unopened (the "?"s), then both of them must be unsafe:

1XX
122
000
