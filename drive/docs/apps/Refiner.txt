[b]--- Refiner ---[/b]
Refiner is a simple but sensitive application. Your work within it is very important. Pay [i]very[/i] close attention to the refining tasks. The refiner is dependent on the tasks. If you refine a number in a project with no relevant task, you will fail.

[b]- Controls -[/b]
Simply click the correct numbers, but not the wrong numbers.

[b]- Example -[/b]
If you have the task "Refine 3s in Omega", start the refiner with [color=purple]refine Omega[/color] and then click [i]all[/i] 3s.
