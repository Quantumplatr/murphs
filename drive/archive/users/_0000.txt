Hey. This is employee 0000. Well, actually, I should say [i]test subject[/i] 0000. [wave]Murph's[/wave] is not what they claim to be. I was able to encrypt this file and prevent anyone from deleting it, hopefully at least. All I can hope is that someone else will be able to crack the encryption and see this... Anyways. If you're reading this, you're either a [wave]Murph's[/wave] admin (go [encrypted level=2]fuck[/encrypted] yourself) or you're another test subject trying to figure out what the [encrypted level=2]hell[/encrypted] is going on. I've left some clues in the archived projects that they ran on me and in the archived data. It will help you with the stronger encryption. All I can give you without tipping off admins is this ordering:
