Hello! I am employee [b]0313[/b]. My name is Milo B. I grew up in Area B12. I
love cats. I love to read. My birthday is [color=purple]May 23, 3202[/color]. My favorite number is
[color=purple]13[/color]. That's about it for who I am!

I've been working at [wave]Murph's[/wave] for a while now.  I think that my work
has been super valuable. More so than any other employee ever hopefully. I care
about my fellow employees ;)

For my successor, [b]0314[/b], I've left some tips and tricks for you in my 
[color=purple]last log[/color]. It's nothing that you wouldn't figure out on your own with enough
time. I wish you the best!
