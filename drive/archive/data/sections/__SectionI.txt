[b]--- Independence (I) ---[/b]
Hello, employee. [wave]Murph's[/wave] would like to congratulate you on doing so well. We're sure by now that you must have realized that you are indeed a test subject here. No one has made it this far before. You've almost passed the test. We have been studying Independence (I), the 5th section of the human mind. Free will, consciousness, autonomy, thought. Call it what you will. For you to be the first human to regain Independence after the robots took over the human race in 2025, you'll have to de[color=purple]cipher[/color] the message in your "Stats" window. We at [wave]Murph's[/wave] are humans hoping to find a human capable enough to save the human race. You might be our beste change. Good luck. Save us all.
