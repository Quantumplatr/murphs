[b]--- README.txt ---[/b]
Welcome, valued employee. Here at [wave]Murph's[/wave], your work is very 
important. So important, in fact, that we cannot disclose what you are actually
doing. Simply do the tasks assigned to you, and be content in knowning that you
are making all the difference.

[b] - Tasks & Applications - [/b]
Go take a look in [color=steel_blue]~/docs[/color] to see details on how to do
certain tasks and how to use the applications.

[b] - Your Predecessor - [/b]
Your predecessor may have been nice and [color=purple]left you a note[/color] in [color=steel_blue]~/archive/users[/color]. 
Most employees leave a simple note saying they loved their job and they wish
you the best.

[b] - Permissions - [/b]
To ensure that you are the most efficient employee you can be, we have designed
your drive such that you only need to look in a few folders. To do your tasks,
you'll only need to access [color=steel_blue]~/docs[/color] and [color=steel_blue]~/projects[/color].

Just in case any naughty employees go digging around, any files, folders, or
text that you are not allowed to see are hidden behind encryption. That will 
look like this: [encrypted]SECRETS[/encrypted].
