[b]--- README ---[/b]
Welcome, valued employee. Here at [wave]Murph's[/wave], your work is very important. So important, in fact, that we cannot disclose what you are actually doing. Simply do the tasks assigned to you, and be content in knowing that you are making all the difference.

[b] - Tasks & Applications - [/b]
You will see your tasks appear in the window on the left labeled [b]Tasks[/b]. You can click on tasks to learn more about them. Each task will use an application and take a project file (E.g. [color=purple]refiner ~/projects/Omega.txt[/color]). Pay attention to the task's details. Some tasks will have no extra details like "Sweep Epsilon". There will be some like "Refine 3s in Omega" where you'll need to be aware to look for 3s.
Go take a look in [color=steel_blue]~/docs[/color] to see details on how to do certain tasks and how to use the applications.

[b] - Your Predecessor - [/b]
Your predecessor may have been nice and [color=purple]left you a note[/color] in [color=steel_blue]~/archive/users[/color]. Most employees leave a simple note saying they loved their job and they wish you the best.

[b] - Permissions - [/b]
To ensure that you are the most efficient employee you can be, we have designed your drive such that you only need to look in a few folders. To do your tasks, you'll only need to access [color=steel_blue]~/docs[/color] and [color=steel_blue]~/projects[/color].

Just in case any naughty employees go digging around, any files, folders, or text that you are not allowed to see are hidden behind encryption. That will look like this: [encrypted]SECRETS[/encrypted].

[b] - The Console - [/b]
If you are unfamiliar with a console like this one, read through [i]BASICS.txt[/i] with [color=purple]read BASICS.txt[/color] to get yourself familiar.
